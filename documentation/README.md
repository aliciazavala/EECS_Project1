Project Page: https://ku-fpg.github.io/teaching/EECS_448_S20_Project1/

Documentation (10%)
You must use some kind of documentation format/software, and to provide documentation of your code. In short, you need to use some means of documentation that can be used to generate HTML documentation of your code. We should be able to open an HTML file to find out all the class information such as method names, signatures, pre and post conditions, etc.

In your GitHub repository, have a folder called documentation that contains all the generated documentation, READMEs, work cited list, and any other needed documentation.

Process Model (5%)
What software process model would be appropriate for this project? State your arguments and briefly describe to what extent you have followed this process model. Write your explanation in a text file called process-model.txt and include it in the documentation folder.

References (5%)
This will be its own section in the documentation. Any work/code that you or a teammate did not write from scratch, must be cited. This should also be in your GitHub repository.
