* Which Process Model was the most appropiate for Project 1? 

The process model that would be appropiate for this project is 'Agile Software Development'.

Agile refers to the software development technique based on iterative development (1), where small increments are built 
over a short period of time, delivering a version of the product fast enough, so that it can be tested constantly, and 
new features can continue to be gradually added (2).

This process model was a good fit for our project since the requirements allowed for some interpretation, meaning that 
we had freedom on how to build the project to a great extent. We also encountered issues in suitable meeting times for
the beginning portion of the project, which was a crucial factor to avoid misunderstandings and confussion between team
members. On top of that, Agile methodoloy does not require a lot of planning in order to get the project started, it is so
easily adaptable for the reality, therefore it was the most appropiate process model for our particular circumstances. 

In addition to that, Agile methodology reduces total development time (1), which was very convenient since most team 
members were actively occupied for the first segment of the project development. For better convenience, developing small
upgrades and to continously test these updates, increased our chances for our team to achieve completeness much faster than
having a rigid sequence of steps to be followed, such as the Waterfall Model. However, we could not make the most use out of
the Agile methodology as it was not easy to meet as a complete group.

To sum up, the Agile methodology worked best for our team because: 

  --> We could not afford a lot of planning time.
  --> We were focused on fast delivery, due to having short period of time and limited organization.
  --> To keep adding and testing new small features/upgrades, in order to keep the project going.

* How did our team implement the Agile Process Model, and to what extent? 

   --> Identified the project requirements, then began working on the project by iteration through different stages
   of new updates and upgrades. 
   
   --> We broke up the project into the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which is the smallest and simplest 
   version of the project, in order to test what was working and what did not work (3). For instance, first we 
   made sure that we had a version of our Calendar App which at least allowed users to create an event, and 
   store that into a file. This was very simple because it was the minimum version of what the Calendar App should do.
   
   --> We accomplish an upgrade, we run and tested it, if it did not work, we fixed it, if it worked, we published it
   and moved to the next upgrade.
