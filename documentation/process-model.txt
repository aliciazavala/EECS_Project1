 
 ---- Process Model ----

The process model that would be appropiate for this project is 'Agile Software Development'.

Agile refers to the software development technique based on iterative development (1), where small increments are built 
over a short period of time, delivering a version of the product fast enough, so that it can be tested constantly,
and new features can continue to be gradually added (2).

This process model was a good fit for our project since we had high levels of uncertainty, meaning that we had freedom 
on how to build the project to a great extent, and we encountered issues in suitable meeting times for the beginning 
portion of the project, which was crucial for designing it. On top of that, Agile methodoloy does not require a lot 
of planning in order to get the project started, it is so easily adaptable for the reality, therefore it was the most 
suitable process model for our team. 

In addition to that, Agile methodology reduces total development time (1), which was very convenient since most team 
members were actively occupied for the first segment of the project development. For better convenience, developing 
small upgrades and continously test these updates, increased our chances for our team to achieve completeness much 
faster than having a rigid sequence of steps to be followed, such as the Waterfall Model.

To sum up, Agile worked best for our team because:

--> We could not afford a lot of planning time.
--> We were focused on fast delivery, due to having short period of time and limited organization.
--> To keep adding and testing new small features/upgrades, in order to keep the project going.

//Delivery in small parts and ability to change fast. This is the most important component. You delivered, market test. Works - okay, move forward. Doesnâ€™t work, change, test and pivot, finally deliver.
//Talk about what were the disadvantages in using Agile (confusion between team members,etc)
However, the Agile methodology did



***notes (to be deleted)****
-Adapted to the specific circumstances
-Incremental and iterative approach, in which the increments are small and typically, new releases of the system are created and made available to customers every few weeks
-Minimize documentation by using informal communications rather than formal meetings with written documents
- Builds a small portion of each feature, one by one, and then voth gradually adding features and increasing their completeness
- We are going to break up what we are going to do into Minimum viable product (MVP), smallest and simplest version, get feedback, see what works and doesn't work
